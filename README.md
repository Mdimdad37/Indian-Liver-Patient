# Indian-Liver-Patient
Content:-
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The “Dataset” column is a class label used to divide groups into a liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Problem statement:-
By using these patient records to determine whether the patients have liver disease or not.

Data description:-
Columns:
1. Age of the patient
2. Gender of the patient
3. Total Bilirubin- Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down. A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood.
4. Direct Bilirubin- Bilirubin attached by the liver to glucuronic acid, a glucose-derived acid, is called direct or conjugated, bilirubin.
5. Alkaline Phosphatase- Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme in a person’s blood that helps break down proteins. Using an ALP test, it is possible to measure how much of this enzyme is circulating in a person’s blood.
6. Alamine Aminotransferase- Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and kidney. ALT is increased with liver damage and is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease.
7. Aspartate Aminotransferase- AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but also in muscles. When your liver is damaged, it releases AST into your bloodstream. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test can help your healthcare provider diagnose liver damage or disease.
8. Total Proteins- Albumin and globulin are two types of protein in your body. The total protein test measures the total amount of albumin and globulin in your body.
9. Albumin- One of the proteins in the human body.
10. Albumin and Globulin Ratio
